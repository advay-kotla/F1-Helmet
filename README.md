# F1-Helmet


What This Project Is

This is a CAD model of a custom display helmet designed to keep as a nice addition to my desk because I always wanted a f1 helmet model.

The Design Process

The project started with importing a very basic, ball-like helmet model. I then made  modifications such as changing the original shape completely by adding aggressive spoilers, vents, and brow features. After this , I  changed the color scheme to a vibrant neon and dark gray combination.

Why I Made This

The entire goal of this project was to create a cool, unique display item to put in my room. The final design and custom colors make it perfect for showing off.
