// 1 - Import and Initial Component Setup

I imported the base helmet geometry. I immediately focused on setting up the raw components, including the brow band, the chin bar, and the top spoiok ler piece, establishing the general aggressive shape and the main eye-port outline before final assembly.

// 2 - Assembling Major Attachments
I finalized the attachment of the large, stylized rear spoiler/vent element and defined the exact cut line for the main visor opening. I ensured the helmet's chin and cheek lines were adjusted.

// 3 - Adding Surface Details and Fillets

I added the small, rounded side mechanisms (ear knobs) and the small vent details on the chin bar. I focused on using the Fillet tool to smooth all transitions between the original helmet body and the new components for a professional, seamless look.

// 4 - Adding Rear Spoiler and Defining Color Layers

I focused on finalizing the physical rear spoiler component and securing its position. This time block was also used to prepare the geometry for color by using the Split-Face tool to create distinct regions and lines across the surface for the final color application.

// 5 - Final Color Application and Rendering

I assigned the final material properties and colors, applying the bright neon lime/yellow and dark gray to the defined split faces. I added clear coat to the main body to give it a vibrant, and glossy look.

// 6 - Added an automatic HANS System Integration

I integrated a conceptual automated HANS mechanism into the rear neck area. This mechanism includes a grey circle button (the actuator) and a system designed to automatically deploy and fit the neck brace when pressed.
